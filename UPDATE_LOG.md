# Update Log

## [1.6.23] - 2025-08-19

### üîÑ RESTORED: User Account Ban Functionality
- **Issue**: User requested to keep "normal ban" functionality for user accounts
- **Solution**: Re-introduced ban/unban buttons and modal to User tab
- **Features**: 
  - Ban button for non-banned users, Unban button for banned users
  - Ban modal with optional reason field
  - Proper form handling and API integration
  - Success/error feedback and automatic user list refresh
- **Result**: Admins can now ban user accounts directly from User tab while still having IP/device banning in Security tab

### üìö ADDED: Device Fingerprint Hash Explanation
- **Feature**: Provided detailed explanation of device fingerprint hashing
- **Purpose**: Helps admins understand what device fingerprinting means in the Security tab
- **Explanation**: Device fingerprint combines browser details, system info, hardware characteristics, and network info to create unique device identifiers

### üîç ADDED: Device Fingerprint Viewing in User Tab
- **Feature**: Added "View Device" button to user table in admin panel
- **Purpose**: Allows admins to easily view and copy device fingerprints for banning
- **Implementation**: 
  - New "View Device" button next to "View IPs" button
  - `showUserDeviceFingerprint()` function displays device fingerprint in alert dialog
  - Shows full device fingerprint hash for copying to Security tab
  - Handles cases where device fingerprint is not recorded
- **Result**: Admins can now easily obtain device fingerprints from the User tab to use in the Security tab for device banning

### üîß FIXED: Device Fingerprint Generation and Storage
- **Issue**: Device fingerprints were "not recorded" even after user logins
- **Root Cause**: No device fingerprint generation code was implemented in the authentication system
- **Fix**: Added `generateDeviceFingerprint()` function that creates SHA256 hash from IP + User-Agent + Accept headers
- **Fix**: Updated registration route to generate and store device fingerprint during user creation
- **Fix**: Updated login route to generate and store device fingerprint during login
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added crypto module import for SHA256 hashing
  - Device fingerprint combines IP address, User-Agent, Accept headers, Accept-Language, and Accept-Encoding
  - Stored in `device_fingerprint` column during registration and updated during login
- **Result**: Device fingerprints are now properly generated and stored for all users

## [1.6.22] - 2025-08-19

### üîß FIXED: Permanent Mute Issue & User Tab Cleanup
- **Issue**: Permanent mutes only worked if a reason was provided (reason should be optional)
- **Root Cause**: Login logic in auth.js was checking `mute_reason !== null && muted_until !== null` which failed for permanent mutes
- **Fix**: Updated login logic to properly handle permanent mutes by checking `mute_reason !== null` first, then handling temporary vs permanent separately
- **Result**: Permanent mutes now work correctly whether a reason is provided or not

### üßπ CLEANUP: Removed Ban Options from User Tab
- **Issue**: Ban options were duplicated between User tab and Security tab
- **Solution**: Removed ban/unban buttons and functions from User tab
- **Added**: "View IPs" button to show user's registration and last login IP addresses
- **Result**: Cleaner User tab interface with no duplicate functionality

### üìç ADDED: User IP Information Display
- **Feature**: New "View IPs" button in User tab shows:
  - User's registration IP address
  - User's last login IP address
  - Instructions to use these IPs in Security tab for banning
- **Purpose**: Helps admins identify and ban problematic IP addresses
- **Implementation**: Simple alert dialog showing IP information

### üîç DEBUGGING: Security Tab Display Issues
- **Issue**: Security tab still only shows refresh button despite complete rebuild
- **Debugging**: Added extensive console logging to check tab visibility and admin section display
- **Test**: Added forced display block on admin sections to test if CSS is hiding content

- **Result**: Users can no longer accept their own friend requests

### üîß FIXED: Dashboard & Security Tab Display Issues
- **Issue**: Dashboard stats and security tab content not displaying despite API calls working
- **Root Cause**: CSS rule `.tab-content { display: none; }` was overriding `.tab-content.active { display: block; }`
- **Fix**: Added `!important` to `.tab-content.active { display: block !important; }` to ensure active tabs are visible
- **Fix**: Fixed "undefined" Chat Messages stat by handling both `totalMessages` and `totalChatMessages` API response fields
- **Result**: Dashboard and security tabs now properly display content

- **Fix**: Updated both class methods and global window functions to use correct property names
- **Result**: UI now properly updates when purchasing water and fertilizer

- **Result**: Dashboard now shows comprehensive server statistics

### üîß FIXED: Sprinkler Growth System
- **Issue**: Sprinklers not growing crops and no console output for growth
- **Root Cause**: `checkSprinklerGrowth()` function was not being called in the game loop

- **Fix**: Added explicit updateSeasonDisplay() call and saveGame() call to setSeason() function
- **Fix**: Added force reflow to updateSeasonDisplay() to ensure DOM updates are applied
- **Result**: Season changes now properly update the display and persist across game sessions
