- **Issue**: Permanent mutes were not being enforced due to SQL query logic error
- **Issue**: Mute enforcement logic was too restrictive, preventing permanent mutes without reasons from being enforced
- **Ban Fix**: Modified `/api/admin/users/:userId/ban` endpoint to make reason optional
  - Changed `if (!reason) return error` to `const banReason = reason || 'No reason provided'`
  - Updated all references to use `banReason` instead of `reason`

## [1.6.24] - 2025-08-19

### üßπ CLEANUP: Removed Redundant Security Logs Section
- **Issue**: Security tab contained a "Security Logs" section that was redundant with the general "Logs" tab

- **Solution**: Removed the Security Logs section from the Security tab to eliminate redundancy
- **Cleanup**: 
  - Removed Security Logs HTML section from Security tab
  - Removed `loadSecurityLogs()` and `newLoadSecurityLogs()` JavaScript functions
  - Removed security logs loading from `newLoadSecurityData()` function

### üîß FIXED: Device Fingerprint Generation and Storage
- **Issue**: Device fingerprints were "not recorded" even after user logins
- **Root Cause**: No device fingerprint generation code was implemented in the authentication system
- **Fix**: Added `generateDeviceFingerprint()` function that creates SHA256 hash from IP + User-Agent + Accept headers
- **Fix**: Updated registration route to generate and store device fingerprint during user creation
- **Fix**: Updated login route to generate and store device fingerprint during login
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added crypto module import for SHA256 hashing
  - Device fingerprint combines IP address, User-Agent, Accept headers, Accept-Language, and Accept-Encoding
  - Stored in `device_fingerprint` column during registration and updated during login

## [1.6.22] - 2025-08-19

### üîß FIXED: Permanent Mute Issue & User Tab Cleanup
- **Issue**: Permanent mutes only worked if a reason was provided (reason should be optional)
- **Root Cause**: Login logic in auth.js was checking `mute_reason !== null && muted_until !== null` which failed for permanent mutes
- **Fix**: Updated login logic to properly handle permanent mutes by checking `mute_reason !== null` first, then handling temporary vs permanent separately
- **Result**: Permanent mutes now work correctly whether a reason is provided or not

### üßπ CLEANUP: Removed Ban Options from User Tab
- **Issue**: Ban options were duplicated between User tab and Security tab
- **Solution**: Removed ban/unban buttons and functions from User tab

- **Result**: Users can no longer accept their own friend requests

### üîß FIXED: Dashboard & Security Tab Display Issues
- **Issue**: Dashboard stats and security tab content not displaying despite API calls working
- **Root Cause**: CSS rule `.tab-content { display: none; }` was overriding `.tab-content.active { display: block; }`
- **Fix**: Added `!important` to `.tab-content.active { display: block !important; }` to ensure active tabs are visible
- **Fix**: Fixed "undefined" Chat Messages stat by handling both `totalMessages` and `totalChatMessages` API response fields

- **Fix**: Updated both class methods and global window functions to use correct property names
- **Result**: UI now properly updates when purchasing water and fertilizer

### üîß FIXED: Dashboard Stats Missing
- **Issue**: Dashboard was only showing 6 stats instead of all available stats from server
- **Fix**: Added all missing stats to dashboard display (Total Friends, Pending Friends, Announcements, Admin Users, Admin Logs, Today's Users, Today's Messages, Filter Words)
- **Result**: Dashboard now shows comprehensive server statistics

### üîß FIXED: Sprinkler Growth System
- **Issue**: Sprinklers not growing crops and no console output for growth
- **Root Cause**: `checkSprinklerGrowth()` function was not being called in the game loop
- **Fix**: Added `checkAllSprinklerGrowth()` function to game loop that checks all plants for sprinkler growth
- **Result**: Sprinklers should now properly grow crops with console output

### üîç INVESTIGATING: Security Tab Display

- **Fix**: Added explicit updateSeasonDisplay() call and saveGame() call to setSeason() function
- **Fix**: Added force reflow to updateSeasonDisplay() to ensure DOM updates are applied
- **Result**: Season changes now properly update the display and persist across game sessions

### üîß FIXED: Water & Fertilizer Purchase Section Placement
- **Issue**: Water and fertilizer purchase section was placed in the middle of the seed shop (after basic seeds)
