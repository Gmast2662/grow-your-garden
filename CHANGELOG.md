  - Both commands include proper admin usage tracking and state isolation
- **Result**: Cleaner admin interface with more useful debugging and testing tools

### Continuous Growth System Implementation
- **Issue**: Plants only advanced one growth stage per watering/fertilizing action, making growth feel choppy
- **Problem**: Players had to repeatedly water/fertilize to see continuous progress, which was tedious
- **Solution**: Implemented continuous growth system where plants grow continuously while watered, fertilized, or within sprinkler range
- **Technical Details**:
  - Added `checkContinuousGrowth()` function to handle continuous growth from watering and fertilizing
  - Modified `waterPlant()` to start continuous growth for 8 seconds instead of advancing one stage
  - Modified `fertilizePlant()` to start continuous growth for 12 seconds instead of advancing one stage
  - Enhanced `checkSprinklerGrowth()` to use time-based continuous growth instead of fixed intervals
  - Added growth tracking properties: `waterGrowthStart`, `waterGrowthDuration`, `fertilizerGrowthStart`, `fertilizerGrowthDuration`
  - Added continuous growth rates: Water (1 stage/2s), Fertilizer (1 stage/1.5s), Sprinkler (1 stage/30s)
  - Integrated continuous growth checks into `updatePlantsSilent()` game loop
  - Added automatic cleanup of growth states when effects expire
  - **Fixed Visual Display**: Updated `drawPlant()` to use `growthStage` directly and added force redraw after growth
  - **Custom Growth Rate System**: Added flexible growth rate system for individual seeds
    - Added `getSeedGrowthMultiplier()` function with custom rates for each seed type
    - Fast growing seeds: Carrot, Lettuce, Radish (0.5x time = 2x faster), Spinach (0.6x), Tomato (0.7x)
    - Normal growing seeds: Most seeds (1.0x time = standard speed)
    - Slow growing seeds: Pumpkin, Sweet Potato, Eggplant (1.5x time = 1.5x slower)
    - Rare seeds with individual rates: Kiwi (1.8x - fastest), Asparagus (2.0x - standard), Strawberry (2.2x), Watermelon (2.5x), Artichoke (2.8x - slowest)
    - Legendary seeds with individual rates: Mango (2.8x - fastest), Apple (3.2x - standard), Pineapple (3.5x), Grape (3.8x), Dragonfruit (4.0x - slowest)
- **Result**: Much more engaging and rewarding growth system - players see continuous progress while effects are active

### Enhanced Sprinkler System Implementation
- **Issue**: Sprinklers only provided growth bonuses but didn't actually cause plants to grow
- **Problem**: Sprinklers were not valuable enough and didn't provide automated growing capabilities
- **Solution**: Implemented active sprinkler growth system that automatically advances plant growth stages
- **Technical Details**:
  - Added `checkSprinklerGrowth()` function to handle automatic sprinkler growth
  - Integrated sprinkler growth checks into `updatePlantsSilent()` game loop
  - Added 30-second cooldown between sprinkler growth advances to prevent spam
  - Added `lastSprinklerGrowth` timestamp tracking to prevent excessive growth
  - Added growth messages and console logging for sprinkler growth events
  - Maintained existing sprinkler bonus system for visual effects
  - Added save game calls after sprinkler growth changes
- **Result**: Much more valuable and strategic sprinkler placement - players can create automated growing zones

### Active Growth System Implementation
- **Issue**: Plants were growing automatically over time, making the game too passive
- **Problem**: Players could plant seeds and wait for them to grow without active involvement
- **Solution**: Completely redesigned growth system to require active player care
- **Technical Details**:
  - Modified `getPlantGrowthStage()` to return stored `growthStage` instead of calculating from time
  - Updated `waterPlant()` to advance growth stage when watering (if not fully grown)
  - Updated `fertilizePlant()` to advance growth stage when fertilizing (if not fully grown)
  - Removed automatic growth updates from game loop
  - Added growth stage advancement messages and visual feedback
  - Maintained cooldown systems and resource consumption
  - Added save game calls after growth changes
- **Result**: Much more engaging and strategic gameplay - players must actively water and fertilize to grow plants

### Improved Seed Selection Persistence
- **Issue**: Seed selection was being cleared after each successful planting
- **Problem**: Players had to re-select the same seed type for multiple plantings, creating inefficient workflow
- **Solution**: Removed automatic seed selection clearing after successful planting
- **Technical Details**:
  - Removed `this.selectedSeed = null` assignment after planting
  - Removed seed item visual deselection (`classList.remove('selected')`)
  - Maintained all other planting functionality (stock reduction, money deduction, plant creation)
  - Seed selection now persists until player manually selects a different seed or tool
- **Result**: Much more efficient planting workflow - players can plant multiple seeds of the same type without re-selection

### Garden Expansion Plant Preservation Fix
- **Issue**: Plants were disappearing when expanding the garden
- **Root Cause**: `expandGarden()` function was calling `this.initializeGarden()` which created a completely new empty garden array, destroying all existing plants
- **Solution**: Modified `expandGarden()` to preserve existing plants when expanding
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Store old garden data before creating new garden array
  - Copy all existing plants and their state (watered, fertilized, etc.) to new garden
  - Preserve all plant properties including growth stage, water/fertilizer status, and timestamps
  - Maintain garden expansion cost progression
- **Result**: Players can now expand their garden without losing their carefully grown plants

### Enhanced Admin Panel Reset Function
- **Issue**: Reset function only reset statistics, leaving expanded garden and game data intact
- **Problem**: Players expected complete reset but garden size and game state remained unchanged
- **Solution**: Enhanced reset function to properly reset all game data to initial state
- **Technical Details**:
  - Reset garden size to 8x8 and recalculate grid dimensions
  - Reset expansion cost to initial $5,000
  - Clear all plants and sprinklers from garden
  - Reset money, water, fertilizer, and score to starting values
  - Reset all tools to level 1
  - Reset shop inventory to initial quantities
  - Update UI and save game after reset
- **Result**: Complete reset now properly returns game to initial state

### Garden Expansion Persistence Fix
- **Issue**: Garden size was resetting to 8x8 when switching save slots or reloading
- **Root Cause**: `gridSize` and `cellSize` were not being updated after loading `gardenSize` from save data
- **Solution**: Added proper initialization of `gridSize` and `cellSize` in the `loadGame()` function
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Updated `loadGame()` to set `this.gridSize = this.gardenSize` after loading garden size
  - Added `this.cellSize = Math.floor(600 / this.gridSize)` calculation
  - Ensures garden dimensions persist correctly across save slot switches
- **Result**: Garden expansion now properly persists when switching slots or reloading the game

### Admin Panel Interface Cleanup
- **Removed Redundant Button**: Eliminated "Show Stats" button from admin panel
- **Reason**: Statistics are already visible in the main game interface
- **Result**: Cleaner, more focused admin panel interface
